## Features
- WiFi Connectivity: The Snake Game supports WiFi connectivity, allowing players to compete with others online.
- MQTT Integration: The game utilizes MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) protocol for real-time communication between players.
- High Scores: Keep track of your high scores and compete with other players to reach the top of the leaderboard.
- Customization: Customize the game settings, such as snake speed and game sound, to suit your preferences.
